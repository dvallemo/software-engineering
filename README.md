### Software vs Hardware decision chart

Hardware:
Pros
I have one year experience in this especially pcb engineering and design process
May be able to get a job that could pay me the same or more in the next month probably if I concentrated on my resume and did some studying on comm protocols
Could take FE exam, devote some time to that and that could give me some leverage in the interviews. 
Projects done in the past would be of use in the interview. 
Cons:
I would hate to work in Altium again 
Projects that I can do by myself are very minimum and low impact
Negative experience where it felt boring and tedious.
The learning will probably end after 10 years of professional experience. 

Software:
Pros
Scalable to my own business or other jobs
Can make my own projects without cost
Unlimited resources, skies the limit
High growth for the future
Higher income with more bonuses 
Can become senior developer within 2 years of professional experience
High impact as in I can develop and build stuff outside of my job
Have a good response to why I left hwe to focus on swe
Some companies may only want javascript and html/css. So I can start there and keep learning until I gert a more senior prostitution in the company or outside
The learning will never end
I can concentrate on other aspects of software after 3-5 years like data science, big data, or machine learning, back end, full stack, skies the limit
I'm really enjoying learning web dev right now, where I would dread to try to go back to altium. 


Cons
Some companies may want DSA and I would have to devote some time to that
I would have zero professional experience starting off. I could maybe spin my resume to work to my favor still with engineering experience and some software classes in undergrad.
Would need to devote some time to learn material while subbing at the same time, I would not get a job maybe in 3-4 months time.
