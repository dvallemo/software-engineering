### Software vs Hardware decision chart

<br Hardware:/br>
<br Pros/br>
<br 1. I have one year experience in this especially pcb engineering and design process/br>
<br 2. May be able to get a job that could pay me the same or more in the next month probably if I concentrated on my resume and did some studying on comm protocols/br>
<br3. Could take FE exam, devote some time to that and that could give me some leverage in the interviews. /br>
<br 4. Projects done in the past would be of use in the interview. /br>
Cons:
<br 1. I would hate to work in Altium again /br>
<br 2. Projects that I can do by myself are very minimum and low impact/br>
<br 3. Negative experience where it felt boring and tedious./br>
<br 4. The learning will probably end after 10 years of professional experience. /br>

<br Software:/br>
<br Pros/br>
<br 1. Scalable to my own business or other jobs/br>
<br 2. Can make my own projects without cost/br>
<br 3. Unlimited resources, skies the limit/br>
<br 4. High growth for the future/br>
<br 5. Higher income with more bonuses /br>
<br 6. Can become senior developer within 2 years of professional experience/br>
<br 7. High impact as in I can develop and build stuff outside of my job/br>
<br 8. Have a good response to why I left hwe to focus on swe/br>
<br 9.Some companies may only want javascript and html/css. So I can start there and keep learning until I gert a more senior prostitution in the company or outside/br>
<br 10. The learning will never end/br>
<br 11. I can concentrate on other aspects of software after 3-5 years like data science, big data, or machine learning, back end, full stack, skies the limit/br>
<br 12. I'm really enjoying learning web dev right now, where I would dread to try to go back to altium. /br>


<br Cons/br>
<brS 1. ome companies may want DSA and I would have to devote some time to that/br>
<br 2. I would have zero professional experience starting off. I could maybe spin my resume to work to my favor still with engineering experience and some software classes in /br>undergrad./br>
<br 3. Would need to devote some time to learn material while subbing at the same time, I would not get a job maybe in 3-4 months time. /br>
